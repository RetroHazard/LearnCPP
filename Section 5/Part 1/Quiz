Question 1
    a)  + Operator functions from L->R
        x = ((3 + 4) + 5)

    b)  = Operator functions from R->L
        (x = (y = z))

    c)  ++ is highest priority, R->L
        + is second highest priority, R->L
        z *= ((++y) +5)

    d)  && is highest priority, L->R
        || is next priority, L->R
        (a || (b && c)) || d
