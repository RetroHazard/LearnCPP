Question #3
==================================================================
a) See webpage for Code Sample:

    The program will output:
    int 5

    s is of type short and will be promoted to int as preferred by the compiler.


b) See webpage for Code Sample:

    Conflict between print() and print(int x=0)
    Calling print() in main() is ambiguous and the compiler will not
    be able to determine which overload to use.


c) See webpage for Code Sample:

    Ambiguous function, both long and double would require conversion.
    Compiler will not know how to determine which conversion to use.
