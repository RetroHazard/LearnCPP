/* Objective:
 * Write a program that:
 *      Asks the user how many names they wish to enter.
 *      Dynamically allocates a std::string array.
 *      Asks the user to enter each name.
 *      Calls std::sort to sort the names
 *      Prints the sorted list of names.
 *      std::string supports comparing strings via the comparison operators < and >.
 *          You donâ€™t need to implement string comparison by hand.
