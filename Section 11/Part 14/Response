Questions:

1)  Whatâ€™s the difference between a void pointer and a null pointer?

        void pointer -  A void pointer can be made to point at objects of any type.
                        Void pointers do not know what type they are, and require special casting in order to dereference.

        null pointer -  A null pointer is a pointer object that points to nothing, or more specifically, an address of 0.
