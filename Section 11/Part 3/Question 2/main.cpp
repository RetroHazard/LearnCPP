/* Objective:
 * Given the array in question 1:
 * Ask the user for a number between 1 and 9.
 * If the user does not enter a number between 1 and 9, repeatedly
 * ask for an integer value until they do.
 *
 * Once they have entered a number between 1 and 9, print the array.
 * Then search the array for the value that the user entered and
 * print the index of that element.
