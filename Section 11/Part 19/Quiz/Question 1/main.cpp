/* Objective:
 *  Pretend youâ€™re writing a game where the player can hold 3 types of items:
 *  health potions, torches, and arrows.
 *
 *  Create an enum to identify the different types of items, and an std::array to
 *  store the number of each item the player is carrying
 *  (the enumerators are used as indexes of the array).
 *
 *  The player should start with 2 health potions, 5 torches, and 10 arrows.
 *  Write a function called countTotalItems() that returns how many items the player has in total.
 *  Have your main() function print the output of countTotalItems() as well as the number of torches.
