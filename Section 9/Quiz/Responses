Question #1
    For each of the following expressions on the right side of operator <<,
    indicate whether the expression is an lvalue or rvalue:

    a) rvalue

    b) lvalue

    c) rvalue

    d) rvalue

    e) lvalue


Question #2
    What is the output of this program?

    7 6
    [Explanation]
        Remember, references cannot be reseated, so ref = y does not
        make ref a reference to y. It assigns the value of y to the
        object ref is referring to (which is x).


Question #3
    Name two reasons why we prefer to pass arguments by const reference
    instead of by non-const reference whenever possible.

    [Answer]
        1. A non-const reference parameter can be used to modify the value
        of the argument. If we do not need this ability, it’s better
        to pass by const reference so that we don’t accidentally modify
        the argument.
        2. A non-const reference parameter can only accept a modifiable
        lvalue as an argument. A const reference-parameter can accept a
        modifiable lvalue, a non-modifiable lvalue, or an rvalue as an
        argument.


Question #4
    What is the difference between a const pointer and a pointer-to-const?

    a const pointer cannot be changed to point at a new memory address
    a pointer-to-const is pointing at a const object, and thus the value
    of the object cannot be changed through the pointer.
