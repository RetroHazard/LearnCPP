Question #1
    Can we determine whether a pointer is a null pointer or not? If so, how?
    a)  Yes, pointers can directly convert to bool and be used for conditional statements

    Can we determine whether a non-null pointer is valid or dangling? If so, how?
    b)  No, a dangling pointer is still pointing at a memory address, even if the
        data found there is no longer valid for the defined purpose.


Question #2
For each subitem, answer “yes”, “no”, or “possibly” to whether the action
described will result in undefined behavior (immediately).
If the answer is “possibly”, clarify when.

    Assigning a new address to a pointer
    a)  No

    Assigning nullptr to a pointer
    b)  No

    Dereferencing a pointer to a valid object
    c)  No

    Dereferencing a dangling pointer
    d)  Yes

    Dereferencing a null pointer
    e)  Yes

    Dereferencing a non-null pointer
    f)  Possibly, if the non-null pointer is dangling.


Question #3
Why should we set pointers that aren’t pointing to a valid object to ‘nullptr’?

    It's important to (re)set pointers to 'nullptr' if they are not pointing to
    a valid object, to prevent unintended behaviour which can be caused by
    dereferencing a dangling pointer.
