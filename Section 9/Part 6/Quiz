Question #1
What values does this program print?
Assume a short is 2 bytes, and a 32-bit machine.

&value  =   0012FF60
value   =   7
ptr     =   0012FF60
*ptr    =   7

&value  =   0012FF60
value   =   9
ptr     =   0012FF60
*ptr    =   9

&otherValue =   0012FF54
otherValue  =   3
ptr         =   0012FF54
*ptr        =   3

sizeof(ptr) =   4
sizeof(*ptr)=   2

===========

Question #2
Whatâ€™s wrong with this snippet of code?

Line 3 attempts to retrieve the value of the pointer (int) and overwrite
it with a memory address (&value), unable to assign mem. addr. to int type.
